    "Key_Interventions": "There is a very wide range of Anti Hypertensive drugs available today and the choice will depend on: 1. The tolerance of the patient to the drug i.e. How the patient responds, and the side effects. 2. The individual choice of the Doctor. and 3. The cost of the therapy - what the patient can afford. In a middle aged Hypertensive patient, Beta-blockers are the frst line drugs, unless specifc indication exists for other drugs. Beta-blockers are drug of choice in Hypertensives with Angina and Tachycardia or tachyarrhythmias. These are time tested drugs that reduce cardiac mortality especially IHD and sudden deaths due to arrhythmias. Problem No. 1: But some patients do not tolerate Beta blockers well and experience either frank bronchospasm with wheezing & rhonchil OR complain of low-grade dry cough. In either case, an alternative drug has to prescribed, preferably a Calcium channel blocker. Problem No. 2: Hypertension is severe, and it may not be controlled with the highest dose of the drug. It is not advisable to prescribe the highest recommended dose. Rather, combine it with another drug, either a Calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor. If there is edema, or obesity, combine with Hydrochlorothiazide. E.g. Dibeta, Hypres-D. Or just change the drug. Problem No. 3: Beta-blockers may increase intermittent claudications in PVD. In diabetics, the dose of oral drugs may have to be adjusted. In an elderly patient: If there is evidence of Ventricular Hypertrophy, or CCF, then start with an ACE inhibitor. Then add a thiazide diuretic, then a Beta blocker or Alfa blocker. If patient is a Diabetic, then start with an ACE inhibitor. (They improve glucose metabolism & prevent nephropathy). If not controlled add a thiazide diuretic, then an Alfa-blocker or Calcium channel blocker. If he has anginal symptoms, then start with a Beta-blocker (or Calcium channel blocker). If patient has cough, asthma or emphysema, then a Calcium channel blocker would be the best drug to start with. If urine shows albumin i.e. Evidence of Renal dysfunction, ACE inhibitor is the drug of choice. If patient has Prostatic symptoms, then drug of choice is an Alpha-blocker. Problem No. 1 (ACE inhibitors): Many patients experience dry cough with ACE inhibitors. Problem No. 2 (ACE inhibitors): The BP is not controlled. Then add a Beta-blocker or a Calcium channel blocker. Or change to another drug. Problem No. 3 (ACE inhibitors): Patient is well controlled on another drug, but has CCF or LVH. If patient is Asthmatic: Then a Calcium channel blocker will be the drug of choice to start with. Problem No. 1 (Calcium Channel Blockers): The BP is not controlled. Then add a diuretic. If necessary add alpha blocker. In non-asthmatics, any other drug may be added. Problem No. 2 (Calcium Channel Blockers): Some patients experience severe headache or giddiness with calcium channel blockers. In such a case the drug has to be changed. Some clinical problems: If Hypertension is detected in a young patient: If the patient is around 30-35 yrs., ask whether his father, uncle or brothers have Hypertension. Because Essential Hypertension appears early in Indian population. But if there is no Family history or the patient is younger than that, defnitely refer him to a physician to rule out Secondary Hypertension. If only Systolic BP is high: Treat frst with a diuretic.

Suspect MDR-TB, if, after 2-3 months of treatment with frst line of drugs, There is no Clinical improvement fever & cough persist, there is no weight gain, or new lymph nodes appear. Patient remains sputum positive. X ray shows increased lesion. Prevention of MDR-TB: Do not give only 2 or 3 drugs in the initial phase of a fresh case. 4-drug therapy is a must. Give correct dose as per body weight. Remember that, if patient weighs > 65 kg, standard 4-drug combipacks do not give sufcient dose. Prescribe drugs for the correct duration. It is safer to give for longer duration, but never less. If patient does not respond, do not add 'one more drug'. You have to start full second line treatment. TB and HIV: Start Regular Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment (AKT). Start ART with Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like Zidovudine, Didanosine, Stavudine, Lamivudine or Abacavir. Other drugs should not be combined with AKT. After completing AKT, start full ART. What will you see in the followup: Is there symptomwise improvement?

This means that the medical treatment can be not just preventive but also curative! The treatment is a fve-step approach to the disease: 1. Exercise. 2. Stress management. 3. Low fat diet. 4. Elimination of known risk factors. 5. Drugs. Exercise: Brisk walking for 45 minutes every day, at least 5 days a week. Walking is the best aerobic exercise for IHD. Yogasanaas, to relax and stretch various muscles. These should be learnt under the guidance of an expert, and also after discussing with the physician as to which exercises and asanaas are permitted to their specifc heart condition. Pranayama: The breath control exercise should be learnt under expert guidance. In its simplest form, i.e. Deep breathing: Sit comfortably. Take slow inspiration over 4-5 seconds. Then release the air slowly over 6-10 seconds. Concentrate only on the sound of breathing and practice for 10 minutes. In severe heart disease, isometric exercises like pull ups, Bullworker, weight lifting and complicated Asanaas are contraindicated. So also, strenuous aerobic exercises like jogging, swimming, mountain climbing may not be advisable. If you don't have an expert guidance, walking remains the best and safest exercise. Stress Management: Meditation for 15 minutes everyday. The aim is to blank the mind from the tensions of daily life, think positively about your own health, and think positively about your own life. One of the ways is to think about the God. Another way is to imagine blank white curtain before the eyes and visualise the blocked vessels getting cleared. One may take help of a suitable guide or course for learning the techniques of stress management.

Limited use of monoun-saturated oils: Olive oil, Groundnut oil, Mohari oil, Canola oil. Limited use of Polyunsaturated oils - Sunfower oil, Corn oil, Karadai oil. Do not take saturated oils - Coconut oil, Dalda, Butter, Ghee. Overall, the intake of oils should be restricted to 2 tsp per day. Never heat oil twice. Twice heated oil is rich in free radicals. This is the problem in road-side eateries and hotels. Increase the fber intake, as fbers reduce the cholesterol absorption from the gut and give early satiety. Eat more vegetables & fruits. Fruits with edible covers should be eaten with the covers. Elimination of known risk factors: Smoking is single most important risk factor for IHD, which must be stopped altogether. Passive smoking (sitting near a smoker) has an equal risk as smoking. Obesity: Weight reduction to ideal weight as per Body mass index l.e. Weight (in kg) divided by (Height in meters)2 should be between 18.5 and 25. The presence of IHD is a signal that you are overweight, and except in a thin patient, the body weight must be reduced by at least 10% within a span of 2-3 months and maintained so. For example, if the patient's weight is 65 Kg. at the time of Infarct or detection of IHD, let it come down to 58 kg. If it is 75 kg., let it come down to 65 kg. If patient is grossly overweight, then calculate the body mass index as given above. (For details, refer chapter 33 on Obesity.). Diabetes: should be strictly controlled. Avoid mental strains, through relaxation,.....and if possible, change of job. Drugs: Tab Aspirin 150 mg. Once a day, after meals (Anti-platelet). Tab Atorvastatin 10 mg. Once a day after night meal.

(Anti-oxidant = Vitamin E 400 iu/day, Vitamins C & A, Trace elements - Zinc & Selenium, Beta-carotene, Omega-3 fatty acids). The above drugs are of preventive importance in IHD and should be prescribed whenever the patient can afford them. If not, then prescribe only Aspirin 150 mg. per day. That's enough! Coronary vasodilators should be used when patient is symptomatic - Tab Ismo 20 mg. 1-1-0. Tab Isordil 10 mg or Tab Angised to be taken sub-lingually if there is anginal pain.

This will prevent you from taking extra servings of the meals. Drink plenty of water, and diluted buttermilk. Avoid rice (Don't exceed half a wati). Take rotis or phulkas, without oil or ghee.

The Bhaji servings should be prepared from Green leafy vegetables, onions, caulifower, lady's fnger, radish, turnips, mushrooms, sprouted pulses. The preparations should be made in minimum or no oil. Oil may be substituted by gravy of tomato, onion, garlic & ginger, in the curry or bhaji for taste. For morning & evening snacks, take recommended fruits, vegetables, and low fat (skimmed) milk. Black tea without sugar has negligible calories. Use Sugarfree (Aspartame) instead of sugar - in tea, coffee or milk. Develop healthy eating habits: Do not eat only 2 large meals a day. It leads to overeating due to hunger. Take snacks in between. It is advisable to eat a good breakfast, and light lunch & dinner. At the same time avoid eating in between. Keep a quiet and pleasant atmosphere in the dining hall. Watching TV while eating, talking, arguments, angry discussions all lead to overeating. Eat slowly, chewing each bite thoroughly, This gives a feeling of satiation. Do not be tempted to fnish up the leftovers. The garbage bin is a better place for these. Use nonstick cooking ware for cooking with no or minimum amount of oil. Simplifed concept of losing weight: Each kg body weight carries 7700 calories i.e. when you create a defcit of 7700 cal, the person loses 1 kg, e.g. to lose 6 kg in 3 months, a defcit of 7700 x 6 = 46,200 cal over 3 months is needed, which is about 500 cal/day. To build this defcit, Adjust the diet to 1200 cal/day = defcit of about 400 cal/day for person with sedentary job. Avoid diets below 1000 cal/day, which can cause dietary defciencies. Moderate daily exercise like a 45 min walk will burn about 150 cal/day. Healty, young persons can exercise more and burn calories faster, but regularity is very essential. The aim should be at losing 1½ ro 2 kg per month, till ideal weight is reached. So create a calorie defciency of 500 cal per day. SAMPLE DIET FOR OBESITY (900 CALORIES): Early morning Light Tea - 1 cup. (2 tsp Milk, no Sugar). Breakfast Milk (Skimmed or Toned) 3½ glass - 150 ml without Sugar. Bread 2 slices. 10 a.m. One fruit serving - Apple, Papaya, Orange, Watermelon, etc. Lunch 1. One large bowl of thin Vegetable Soup, without Butter. 2. One wati salad - Cabbage, Cucumber, Onion, Carrot, Tomato etc. 3. One Roti or Chapati, or 3 Phulkas (without oil) and ½ bowl Rice Or 1 bowl Rice and 1 Phulka or 1½ Roti or Paratha. 4. One wati cooked Vegetables. 5. 1 wati thin Dal. 6. 1 wati thin Buttermilk. 4 p.m. Light Tea - without Sugar - 1 cup. Bread 1 slice or one Idli or a Fruit. Dinner 1. Thin Soup and fresh Salad or boiled Vegetables. 2. 2 thin Phulkas. 3. 1 wati Vegetable. 4. 1 wati thin Dal or Pulses. 5. Thin Buttermilk. Bedtime Skimmed Milk - ½ glass.

    "Key_Interventions": "FOR THE PATIENT ON TRAVEL: When your patient is going on a long travel like a pilgrimage or say a South India Tour, he may come to you seeking advice about the care to be taken during traveling and about what medications he should carry for minor problems during the travel. You should advise them about - Precautions to take - in general, and depending upon the destination, care to be taken in extreme hot or extreme cold weathers, and at high altitudes. You should give them commonly required medications to carry, as contacting a doctor is difcult during the tight schedules of traveling. Travels to some areas may require preventive vaccines to be given. Vaccines: Typhoid and Cholera vaccines should be given a week before the travel. They are a must, if traveling to unhealthy places like Kumbhamela, where thousands or lakhs of people gather. If traveling to Bihar, Assam, Kala-azar vaccine is recommended.

Vomiting due to Motion Sickness: These instructions are for those who suffer from Motion sickness, i.e. vomiting induced by traveling. In a car - Sit facing forwards, preferably on the front seat, and watch distant horizon. Roll down the window for fresh air. If discomfort or nausea is felt, stop the car and walk around a bit. In a Bus - Take front seat behind the front door and look ahead. Do not look at the trees passing by from side window. In a Boat - Take a low level cabin, in the middle portion, which rocks the least. If symptomatic, go to the top deck and look at the horizon. In a Plane - Choose a window seat near the wings and look out often. Do not read while traveling. Travelling to High Altitude (Himalayas): Patients with compromised cardio vascular or Respiratory functions should be advised to avoid",
    "Oral_Drug_Treatment": "traveling to high altitudes above 2000 meters. Hypoxia can cause brain edema with disorientation, palpitation and vertigo. Acute Mountain sickness: If there is uncontrolled headache, severe nausea & vomiting, insomnia, becomes confused or irrational, the person should immediately descend down (preferably lifted down to avoid exertion) by 1000 meters or to a height where he was asymptomatic. Start Oxygen when available. Those who travel to high altitude suddenly in Helicopter or plane, have more acute and severe problems, which require emergency treatment in Hyperbaric Oxygen chamber and transport back to lower altitude. Trekker's rule above 3000 meters (9000 feet) - 'Not more than 300 meters ascent in a day, and spend 2 nights in the same place every 1000 meters'. Care for Cold Weather: Proper protective Warm Clothing as demanded by the place and presence of snow. Cotton swabs to keep external ear canals closed. Care for Sunburns and Snow Blindness: Sunscreen lotion, and Lip guard: to protect from Solar dermatitis & Sunburns. Apply Sunscreen half hour before going in the Sun, and repeat application after 4-5 hrs. Protective Dark Sunglasses (which should flter Ultraviolet rays): A must for looking at snow shining in the Sun.

Look at the tongue, conjunctiva & nails for anemia. Note the nail margin for nail eating habit. With a torch, inspect oral cavity, tonsils, look carefully for caries - refer to dentist if",
    "Oral_Drug_Treatment": "carious teeth. Examine the skin for skin diseases. Especially scabies in fnger webs and ringworm over lower abdomen and groin. Palpate the abdomen for Liver and spleen. Auscultate the heart for murmurs. Note if there is stammering while talking. If any health problem is seen, note it down for informing the parents who are expected to take the further action. Swimming Pool Health Checkup: Look mainly for contagious skin diseases - Ringworm in groins or elsewhere, and scabies over hands between the digits. Acute conjunctivitis makes one temporarily unft till cured. Ask for H/o Epilepsy. Auscultate to rule out gross heart disease where vigorous exercise (Swimming) would be contraindicated. Ask H/o Breathlessness on exertion and angina. Driving License Health Checkup: Test Acuity of vision. If candidate cannot count fngers from a 20 feet distance, refer him to ophthalmologist for correction glasses before giving ftness. You must rule out colour blindness. You should buy Ishihara charts (set of 24 charts), or get them from any Ophthalmology Textbook or websites (www.toledo-bend.com/colourblind/ ishihara.html). If the candidate has Red-Green colour blindness, do not give ftness certifcate. Ask for H/o Epilepsy. If yes, candidate is unft for driving. A general Health checkup for Diabetes, Hypertension, and in elderly - for IHD. Elderly Health Checkup: Check weight - If Obese, instruct on Diet and Exercises. Check Blood Pressure for Hypertension. Inspect tongue and conjunctiva for Anemia. Examine oral cavity for Teeth condition, Ulcers or growth, Leukoplakia. Look for Lymph nodes in neck, axilla and groins. Look for Leg edema. Examine CVS and RS. Examine abdomen for Liver, Spleen, Any lump or Hernia. Inspect eyes for cataract. Whisper and check for diminished hearing. Checkup for Health Insurance (eg. L.I.C.): If you wish to be appointed as L.I.C.'s Medical Examiner, you have to apply in the prescribed form, to the Division ofce, with the Branch Manager's recommendation. You should be an established practitioner with at least 5 yrs experience. The History and checkup are carried out in a fxed routine format as per the forms supplied by the LIC of India. The frst part of the form records basic information including name, age, sex, Identifcation marks, Height in cms, Weight in Kgs, Abdominal girth at umbilicus, Chest girth at nipple level in males (just below axilla in females), Pulse rate and Blood pressure. The second part involves A detailed History of past illnesses/Surgeries/accidents and injuries/past major investigations/Bad Habits. General Examination of Eye, ENT, Teeth, Lymph nodes. Systemic Examination of CVS, RS, CNS, and Abdomen - in particular, Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and Hernia. Scars of previous surgery or accident. In females: Pregnancy, Diseases of uterus or breast. Doctor's opinion - Is the overall appearance Healthy or not? If any serious illness is detected, the person should be referred to specialists recognized by the company. Note: Other insurance companies' forms may differ in minor details. A word for Charity: Monetary gains apart, Medical practice is and will always be a very noble profession. Nobody can expect a doctor to work without pay or fees. He also has to live in this world, where everyone has to struggle for his livelihood, and then maintain his status in the society with a decent living and provide for his family and future. But at the same time we should not forget the weaker sections of our society, who cannot afford even basic healthcare. When we practice in a decent area, we don't even get to see this section. They do not dare to come to us and we conveniently feel that there is no such thing as a poor man, or that if they are, they should go to the government hospital and get treated. But our turning a blind eye does not make them non existent. If we look at them with empathy and spend a small part of our time for them, they will be immensely benefted and we will get tremendous satisfaction & goodwill, and that is the reward. How can we do this? Here is some loud thinking - Are there any charitable trusts working in your city or vicinity or near by village, where your free services would be wanted? If an organisation is already functioning, can you offer your services one day in a week, or one session in a week, or one day in a month, or one hour every afternoon? If it is not your nature to work in an organisation, then can you arrange a part time charitable clinic yourself? Can you attach yourself to an organisation doing medical related work for example organisation of blood donation camps? You could be the motivator, or the organiser depending on your likings. Do you have oratory skills? Can you give lectures to school or college students to create health awareness, or",
    "Injectable_Topical_Other_Drug_Treatment": "to discuss problems of adolescent children? Can you teach frst aid to groups of college students or teachers? Can you give lectures about antenatal health and infant care to members of women organisations? Can you participate in awareness drives for AIDS, Tuberculosis, Diabetes etc. Or may be you could invite other orators and arrange such programmes? You can utilize the sample medicines received, for the poor amongst your regular patients, and arrange for signifcant samples from pharmaceutical companies for camps or charitable dispensaries. Can you offer free consultation to Associations for Handicapped, Schools for Blind, Old age homes, Orphanages etc? Can you give free services if there is a natural disaster near by such as food, earthquake etc? If you persistently think about and look for such opportunities, one day you will defnitely fnd an outlet to do something constructive. Spend a few hours of every month working for a charity, without ego, without expecting any returns, without mixing it with your regular practice, and then at end of a few years, when you will look back and assess your life, you will have a smile of satisfaction on your face.",

    "Key_Interventions": "This section contains various practical tips and information for medical practitioners. Iron sucrose complex: This Iron can be injected without the fear of anaphylactic reactions. Total dose = Body weight in Kg x Hb defcit in gm% x 0.24 + 500 mg for iron depot (15 mg/kg body wt.). To treat anorexia, stimulate appetite and weight gain, apart from Cyproheptadine, you have a choice of Buclizine HCI (Longifene 25 mg tabs & syrup) 1-2 tabs 1/2 hr before meals, or in children 1-2 tablespoonful 1/2 hr before meals, 2 times/day. For patients with peptic ulcer, prescribing any NSAID involves a risk of bleeding or perforation. For affording patients, prescribe Ketotifen 30 mg patch (Ketopatch) - a skin patch to be applied over or near the site of pain, once a day. It is nearly as effective as orally administered NSAID. Fluconazol - a costly but effective antifungal. Note the doses: For Taenia cruris (Groin) - 150 mg tab, once a week x 4 weeks. For Taenia versicolor - 200 mg tab, 2 stat. Single dose. For onychomycosis (nails) - 150 mg tab, once a week x 6-12 months. For oral candidiasis - 50 mg tab, OD x 1-2 weeks. For Vaginal candidiasis - 150 mg one tab stat, single dose. Hyperlipidemia in Indian population: Raised Triglyceride levels are more common in Indian population, for which statin, the commonly prescribed drug is less effective. Prescribe Fenofbrate (Lipicard) 200 mg OD or Gemfbrozil (Lopid, Lipigem) 300 mg BD 1/2 hr before meals. For dressing difcult, non healing wounds, some newer techniques are now available. If slough covers the ulcer, apply Solutyl (Collagenase) ointment once daily, till the slough disappears. This is chemical debridement agent. To stimulate granulations, apply Oxoferrin (Tetrachlor-decaoxide) liquid, 2 times/day. Non-healing wounds and larger areas like burns should be covered by Collagen sheets (Kollgen) and kept open. The sheet is changed once a week, till the wound heals or is ready for skin grafting, if too large. Alendronate: The wonder drug for Post-menopausal osteoporosis. It prevents bone resorption by osteoclasts and increases the bone mineral density. The 10 mg tablet must be taken frst thing in the morning with a glass of water. The patient should not lie down (should sit or stand erect) and eat no food for 1/2 hour. Of course, this is in addition to Calcium, Vitamin D3, and Premarin therapy. Glucosamine sulphate, 500 mg tablet: In chronic knee pains due to osteoarthritis, where cartilage is destroyed, prescribe Cartilamine 500 mg TDS for 3 months, and then OD for 3-6 months. It rebuilds and restores the cartilage and improves the pain and joint fexibility. Of course, a costly drug. For muscle sprains and spasms, whether due to infammation or trauma, prescribe the specifc skeletal muscle relaxant - Tizanidine (Sirdalud) 2 mg tab TDS x 5-7 days. It also has an analgesic action, so additional NSAID may or may not be prescribed. It may cause mild sedation. \\",
    "Oral_Drug_Treatment": "Delaying cataract and macular degeneration. Delaying skin ageing. For chronic. skin problems like dermatitis or psoriasis. Keep a patch of Nitroglycerine (Nitroderm TTS) in your emergency bag. Whenever you suspect Myocardial infarct or unstable angina, in addition to the sublingual Isordil & Aspirin, apply a Transdermal Nitroglycerine patch, for a continuous coronary vasodilator action. Some Practical Tips: If an apparently healthy patient complains of a sense of suffocation on lying down, (specially after a meal), has to get up and sit for comfort, then think of a serious cardiac problem: LVF & MI. The inability to sleep horizontal, and not insomnia, can be recognized only by careful history taking. Whenever you write an NSAID or Steroid in your prescription, always ask History of acidity, sour eructations or ulcer-like symptoms... refexly. If a Diabetic patient is taking a Beta-blocker (for IHD or Hypertension), keep in mind that the signs of Hypoglycemia are masked. When hypoglycemic, patient may complain of vague misguiding symptoms like uneasiness in abdomen or chest, heaviness in head,.. or may suddenly become unconscious without any indication. If a patient has seen several doctors before you, but is still not relieved, do not get infuenced by the previous diagnosis. Start with a doubt - is the previous diagnosis wrong? Is anything missed? And examine the patient with a fresh mind, preferably before seeing the old reports. The converse also holds true. Never be dogmatic, specially about the frst impression (spot diagnosis). Anyone could be wrong - including intelligent doctors like you and me. So let the mind always think - Can it be anything else? Whenever a patient complains of difculty in opening the mouth, without any painful lesion or swelling, think of tetanus. When a patient presents with fever, check the temperature with a thermometer, and record the temperature. Your assistant can do it in the waiting room in advance. The patient already knows that he has fever, he wants to know how much it is. Every teenage girl, before marriage should take rubella vaccine. It will drastically reduce the incidence of congenital heart diseases. If taken after marriage, allow no pregnancy for 3 months after vaccination. Patients of Hyperlipidemia, taking Statins for a long time, often complain of severe muscle pains, heaviness and sensation of weakness in the thighs and knees. It is exaggerated by Long walk and climbing stairs. This is Statin related Myopathy. Reduce the dose, or give on alternate days, monitoring the LDL levels.

    "Procedures_Therapies": "Some Practical Tips: If an apparently healthy patient complains of a sense of suffocation on lying down, (specially after a meal), has to get up and sit for comfort, then think of a serious cardiac problem: LVF & MI. The inability to sleep horizontal, and not insomnia, can be recognized only by careful history taking. Whenever you write an NSAID or Steroid in your prescription, always ask History of acidity, sour eructations or ulcer-like symptoms... refexly. If a patient has seen several doctors before you, but is still not relieved, do not get infuenced by the previous diagnosis. Start with a doubt - is the previous diagnosis wrong? Is anything missed? And examine the patient with a fresh mind, preferably before seeing the old reports. The converse also holds true. Never be dogmatic, specially about the frst impression (spot diagnosis). Anyone could be wrong - including intelligent doctors like you and me. So let the mind always think - Can it be anything else? Whenever a patient complains of difculty in opening the mouth, without any painful lesion or swelling, think of tetanus. When a patient presents with fever, check the temperature with a thermometer, and record the temperature. Your assistant can do it in the waiting room in advance. The patient already knows that he has fever, he wants to know how much it is. Every teenage girl, before marriage should take rubella vaccine. It will drastically reduce the incidence of congenital heart diseases. If taken after marriage, allow no pregnancy for 3 months after vaccination.

Give sublingual sorbitrate immediately. If the pain radiates to Left arm or Jaw, it is very suggestive of cardiac pain. Advise ECG, Echocardiography and evaluation for IHD. II. Chest pain related to Breathing: Rib fractures give rise to severe pain on breathing, but then H/o Trauma and local tenderness makes diagnosis obvious. In absence of Trauma, pain on breathing = Pleural pathology. Pleural Pain: If fever & dyspnoea are mild to moderate, Pleuritis or Pleural effusion. Confrmed by reduced air entry, X-ray and USG. If High fever, tachypnoea and toxic, Acute Lobar pneumonia. If breathlessness is severe, out of proportion to the pain - Refer immediately to Hospital for X-ray Chest. If pain is in Right lower Chest, in addition to X-ray, Ask for Ultrasonography of Liver for Amoebic Liver abscess and Cholecystitis. III. Chest Pain related to Chest wall: When local rib tenderness: Think of fracture of rib, new or old. Think of costo chondritis - very common anteriorly, with 2nd to 4th ribs giving parasternal tenderness OR 12 th Rib tenderness in Tietze's syndrome. Is it sprain of overlying muscle? Has it followed lifting of heavy weight? When Intercostal Tenderness: Suspect Empyema - With diminished breath sounds. On Right side - Amoebic Liver abscess.

If there is increasing pain, or if fngers show change of colour to white or blue, consider it an absolute emergency. Take the patient immediately & personally to orthopedic surgeon for immediate removal of plaster. Delay of 2-3 hrs may cause gangrene! Encourage the patient to keep his muscles active.

Delayed healing of wounds, carbuncles. Balanoposthitis in males, vulval itching in females. Tingling of limbs. Advise regarding diet restriction: Say 'NO' to Sugar, all sweets, cakes, sweetened biscuits, jam, honey, sweetened drinks, sweet fruits like mangoes and grapes, canned sweet fruits, Synthetic juices, Tuberous roots like Potato, Sweet Potato & Tapioca. Eat in plenty: All leafy vegetables, tomato, cucumber, brinjal, caulifower, lady's fnger etc., soup (tomato/vegetable), butter milk, sugar free drinks, tea/coffee with sweeteners, all cereals, sprouted pulses. Eat restricted quantities: Cereals, chapati, roti, bread, cornfour, plain or salted biscuits, rice, meat, eggs, chicken, fsh, skimmed milk. Other instructions: Regularise timings and quantity of meals. Be careful in festivals and marriages, compensate for extra sweets by reducing previous and subsequent meals. Do not remain starving for long periods. Avoid alcoholic drinks. Fruits for Diabetics: A. Fruits to Avoid: Very High in Sugar - Mango, Banana, Grapes, Fig, Cherries, Custard Apple (Sitaphal), Dried dates, Dried apricots & raisins. High in Sugar - Orange Pineapple, Jackfruit, Chikoo. B. Fruits to Eat: but in moderate quantity Apple, Guava, Peach, Apricot, Avocado, Pear (Most fruits with edible skin). The choice of drugs: If obese, control on Biguanides, diet & weight reductions. Add sulfonyl urea when require. If thin patient, control on Biquanide or sulfonyl urea, diet & exercise. Both drugs if required. In either case, if diabetes is not controlled by maximum dose of tablets, add insu. How to start: A. If Post Prandial (P.P) Blood sugar is 160 to 200 mg %: Advise: Strict diabetic diet. Regular exercise, (Weight reduction if Obese). Check Bl. sugar-F & PP after 15 days. If normal, check every 6 mths - 1 yr. If still High, start T. Glyciphage ½ daily (for obese patient), after food. or T. semi-daonil 1 daily (for thin patient), before food. Adjust the dose as required. If a good control is maintained by a very small dose e.g. ½ Tab of Semi-daonil or Glyciphage, then after a few days, stop the drug and observe, whether the patient can be maintained on diet and exercise only. If fasting sugar is normal and post-prandial is high, frst try Acarbose, which reduces carbohydrate absorption e.g. Tab Glucobay 50 mg tds x to be taken with frst morsel of meals (costly drug). If this fails to control the post-prandial hyperglycemia, ",

Exercise, (Weight reduction if obese) 3. T. Glyciphage 1 OD if obese. 4. T. Euglucon/Glynase/Glimy 1 OD if thin. How to increase the dose? Example 1: Obese patient - T. Glyciphage 1 OD - 1 BD (Metformin). Then - T. Glyciphage 1 BD + T. GP1 1 mg OD - BD (Glimepiride). Then - T. Glyciphage-GP1 1 BD + Tab PPG 0.3 mg OD (Vibligose). Then - T. Glyciphage-GP2 1 BD + Tab PPG 0.3 mg OD + Inj. Insulin. Example 2: Thin Patient - T Daonil ½ OD - 1 OD - bd - 1 tds (Glibenclamide). Then - T Daonil 1 tds + T. Glyciphage 1 OD - 1 tds. Then - T Daonil + Glyciphage + T. Pioz 15 mg OD (Pioglitazone) or T Sitagliptin 100mg OD. Then - T Daonil + Glyciphage + T. Pioz 15 mg OD + Insulin. When to start Insulin: Type I i.e. Juvenile or Insulin dependant Diabetes (IDDM). Type II i.e. Maturity onset or NIDDM, if oral drugs fail to control the sugar levels. i.e. PP remains > 160 mg%, and HbA1C > 7%. Any Diabetic in a stressful condition, like infection, Surgery, Pregnancy, Jaundice, Keto-acidosis or Diabetic coma. Complications of Diabetes - Like Peripheral neuritis, Diabetic Nephropathy or Diabetic Retinopathy. Other Instructions: Always keep sugar in Pocket. Watch for Hypoglycemia i.e. sweating Headache, Hunger, irritability & slurred speech. Keep address card in pocket mentioning that he is a diabetic and if found unconscious, he should be immediately taken to doctor and given I.V. 25% dextrose. Care of the feet: Wash the feet daily, dry them inspect them. Inspect soles with mirror, inspect interdigital spaces & then sprinkle lot of Talcur Powder. Avoid walking barefoot, even home. Wear soft cotton Socks & camin shoes. Avoid tight ftting shoes chappals. Use new footwear care to avoid shoebites. Cut nails very carefully and always after bath. when they are sof. Additional prescriptions: Cap. Becozinc 1 daily (Bcomplex + Zinc = 2L-1). Advisable for every diabetic, and must be given if diabetes is severe, long standing or associated with peripheral neuritis. Tab Bio E 400 mg OD (Vit E = 2F) or Tab Antoxid 1 BD (Antioxidants = 2P). For elderly diabetics with atherosclerosis, IHD or hypertension. Tab GLA-120 1 bd (Omega-3 fatty acid + alphalipoic acid = 2P) To delay microvascular complications - nephropathy & retinopathy. If you want to prescribe a liquid tonic, avoid the tonics with syrup base. Prefer Tab /Cap. If a Diabetic patient needs an antihypertensive, prefer ACE inhibitors. If urine shows albuminuria, indicating diabetic nephropathy, ACE inhibitor is the drug of choice e.g. Tab Envas 2.5 - 10 mg OD (Enalapril = 6AD-1), or Tab Listril 2.5 - 20 mg OD (Lisinopril = 6AD-3). If Diabetic neuropathy, with Tingling Tab Meconerv 500 mcg BD x several months. (Mecobalamine = 2H-4a). If painful Neuropathy: Tab Pregastar 150 mg BD (Pregabalin = 4AB or Gabapentin). Tab Ultracet 1 BD (Tramadol - Opiate analgesic = 3B-3). Tab Amitone 25 mg HS (Amitryptiline = 4FA-12). If Diabetic on Beta-blocker: If a beta-blocker has to be given, e.g. due to associated IHD, then the dose of Sulphonylurea has to be reduced, and patient instructed to be careful to avoid hypoglycemia. How to choose a Sulphonylurea? If only P.P. is high and fasting is normal, prefer a short acting sulphonylurea: Tab. Glynase 2.5-5 mg OD (Glipizide = 10D-4). Tab. Glizide 80 mg OD (Gliclazide = 10D-5). If both F & PP are high, select a long acting sulphonylurea: Tab. Daonil 2.5-5 mg OD (Glibenclamide = 10D-3). Tab. Glimy 1-2 mg OD (Glimepiride = 10D-6). If patient has retinal changes, the drug of choice is Gliclazide (and of course Insulin): Tab. Glizide 80 mg OD - BD (Gliclazide = 10D-5). If patient cannot schedule his meals, eats at irregular hours or fasts often, then select a Meglitinide (Ultra short acting), dose as per size of the meal: Tab Rapiline 1-2 mg tab, just before each meal (Repaglinide = 10H-2) OR Tab Glinate 60-120 mg 15 min before meals (Nateglinide = 10H-2). Choice of other Drugs: If optimal dose of Sulphonylurea is reached, instead of increasing it further, you may add alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It delays glucose absorption and prevents sudden surge of glucose after meals. e.g. Tab Glimy 2 mg BD (optimal dose) + Tab Vocarb 0.3 mg OD to TDS. If Post-Prandial levels are persistently high, with normal fasting and preprandial levels: Tab Rebose 25 mg TDS with frst bite of each meal (Acarbose = 10 F-2). Tab Vocarb 0.3 mg, before each meal (Voglibose = 10F-3). Insulin Dose in difcult cases: If P.P. sugar is high, increase dose of Lente Insulin in morning or give plain insulin before lunch. But if urine sugar is high before lunch, add Plain Insulin to morning dose. If sugar is high at bedtime (Post dinner) or early morning, add Plain Insulin to night dose. But give a lesser dose at night, and do not increase",

Do not treat old ladies with white discharge or bleeding, symptom-atically. Every case of cervical erosion, which bleeds on touch or does not heal after cauterisation should be subjected to biopsy.

Newly married couples should also be explained about ovulation cycle, safe period & fertile period. II. For Couple with Children: The best choice would be between Cu-T, IUPD & Pills. Copper-T and IUPD have the advantage that the couple does not have to worry everyday about contraception. Copper-T needs to be replaced once in 3 years. Intrauterine Progesterone Devise (Emily/ Mirena) changed every 5 yrs (Levonorgestrel 52 mg). So there is less tension of failure. Of course, any method if followed regularly will be equally effective. Condoms, diaphragms, chemical contraceptives, all need to be used every time and require proper planning & privacy, which is why failure rates are higher with them. III. If a couple does not desire any more children: Advise permanent contraception by tubectomy or vasectomy. But if the couple has only one Child or two, advise to wait till the child is 5 yrs. old before a permanent contraception is done. Till then CuT or any other method should be followed. If a lady forgets to take a pill? Ask her to take one extra pill next day.

What is safe period? Provided cycles are regular, 10th day to 20th day is considered as fertile period. The remaining days is the safe period, when pregnancy will not occur. However, this is not a reliable method for contraception, as the date of ovulation can be variable.

    "Procedures_Therapies": "partners may just refuse to accept that there is any problem. The marital problems are innumerable. You should use your own judgement, tacts and authority to solve individual problems. This is undoubtedly a time-consuming process. But it brings you closer to the family and earns you as much respect as earned by saving the life of a family member. The role of a Family Physician as a senior member of the family lies here, because you have the advantage of being a very close family member, and at the same time a third person, in whom the couple can confde. Counselling means allowing people to express their feelings and to listen sympathetically, without acting a judge. Both partners should be made to talk in presence of both, and you should be a good listener. You should never take sides, though that is a very tempting thing to do. Stage 1: First you should make the couple identify, what is their target problem. If there is associated sexual problem, treat it a little later. Solve other marital problems frst. Let them discuss as to what changes in the other partners behavior does each expect and what will be the result of such a change. Ask them to write down: what aspects of each other's behavior they like & what they dislike and bring the lists for the second session of discussion. Stage 2: Once the problems are so defned and the changes expected, made known to each other, you should encourage them to agree to these changes and act accordingly till the next meeting. Meet them once a week, and encourage them to continue the changed approach. Many times, this is enough to resolve minor conficts. Stage 3: If the couple fails to keep up the words, then help them to analyse in detail, why this has failed. If the expectation was too demanding, suggest a lesser expectation or a different approach. Also ask them to write down a contract. At this stage, you should make specifc suggestions and advise. Certain points must be stressed during counselling: Trust: Trust is the base of the marriage altar. Suspicion about small matters should not be allowed to dominate. Troubled couples have higher need for trust than average. They should always inform their whereabouts, be punctual -without feeling controlled or suspected. Independence of working & earning wives has to be accepted by the husbands in today's changed society. Males should not expect wives to be dependent on them. Communication of affection towards each other, through words and action is very important in marriage. Just feeling affection is not enough. Encourage the couple to express their affection and to organise outings together such as a flm or a special meal which both of them would like. If alcohol addiction is the problem, tackle it aggressively with the help of a psychiatrist. If extra marital relations is a problem, extensive persuasion to end such relationship is required from you & from elders of the family. Consider Change of Place or city. Otherwise, end of marital relations is inevitable.",

    "Symptom": "Impotence or Erectile Dysfunction",
    "Key_Interventions": "If the man can obtain erection on his own by masturbation, but not with the wife during intercourse or cannot sustain it, then the cause is defnitely psychogenic. If Penis & testes are normally developed, primary total impotence is very rare. The Causes: Anxiety about performance - The thoughts of anticipation of impotence further increase the tension and dysfunction. Fear of rejection by wife, in case he fails to satisfy her. Feeling of guilt about sexual enjoyment - especially in orthodox families. Childhood impressions that sex is very bad, haunt the adult mind, create a guilt feeling & erection is lost. Sexual Exercise is the most important part of treatment, and demands tremendous co-operation & motivation from the couple, especially from the wife. Step 1: Non genital pleasuring. for 4 wks, the couple only limits the activity to caressing each other's bodies. Strictly, no attempt is made for intercourse. This helps to reduce the main problem of performance anxiety & fear of failure, at the same time increases affection. If one of the two, does not accept this step, then probably there is some marital problem and it is better to refer the couple to a psychiatrist for psychoanalysis. Step 2: The couple indulges in Genital pleasuring with hand or mouth, but without orgasm, and strictly no attempt at intercourse. The couple is encouraged to talk & express their pleasure to each other. If there is erection, allow it to subside, then stimulate again - to remove the fear of losing erection. Continued for at least 4 wks. Step 3: The couple is encouraged, to attain extravaginal orgasm. Gradually, penetration is permitted, but withdrawn to have ejaculation outside vagina. The husband is encouraged to practice perineal exercises mentioned below. Step 4: Finally, after several weeks, when the couple has gained confdence in itself, intravaginal ejaculation is allowed. The entire therapy is long drawn and demands tremendous co-operation from the wife. The wife must be motivated and explained her role independently, particularly stressing that if at any point, she shows negative response such as anger or frustration, the treatment will fail and problem will become even more difcult. Perineal Exercises: When there are partial erections which patient cannot maintain, ask him to practice perineal exercises.

If a couple does not desire any more children: Advise permanent contraception by tubectomy or vasectomy. But if the couple has only one Child or two, advise to wait till the child is 5 yrs. old before a permanent contraception is done. Till then CuT or any other method should be followed.

    "Procedures_Therapies": "partners may just refuse to accept that there is any problem. The marital problems are innumerable. You should use your own judgement, tacts and authority to solve individual problems. This is undoubtedly a time-consuming process. But it brings you closer to the family and earns you as much respect as earned by saving the life of a family member. The role of a Family Physician as a senior member of the family lies here, because you have the advantage of being a very close family member, and at the same time a third person, in whom the couple can confde. Counselling means allowing people to express their feelings and to listen sympathetically, without acting a judge. Both partners should be made to talk in presence of both, and you should be a good listener. You should never take sides, though that is a very tempting thing to do. Stage 1: First you should make the couple identify, what is their target problem. If there is associated sexual problem, treat it a little later. Solve other marital problems frst. Let them discuss as to what changes in the other partners behavior does each expect and what will be the result of such a change. Ask them to write down: what aspects of each other's behavior they like & what they dislike and bring the lists for the second session of discussion. Stage 2: Once the problems are so defned and the changes expected, made known to each other, you should encourage them to agree to these changes and act accordingly till the next meeting. Meet them once a week, and encourage them to continue the changed approach. Many times, this is enough to resolve minor conficts. Stage 3: If the couple fails to keep up the words, then help them to analyse in detail, why this has failed. If the expectation was too demanding, suggest a lesser expectation or a different approach. Also ask them to write down a contract. At this stage, you should make specifc suggestions and advise. Certain points must be stressed during counselling: Trust: Trust is the base of the marriage altar. Suspicion about small matters should not be allowed to dominate. Troubled couples have higher need for trust than average. They should always inform their whereabouts, be punctual -without feeling controlled or suspected. Independence of working & earning wives has to be accepted by the husbands in today's changed society. Males should not expect wives to be dependent on them. Communication of affection towards each other, through words and action is very important in marriage. Just feeling affection is not enough. Encourage the couple to express their affection and to organise outings together such as a flm or a special meal which both of them would like. If alcohol addiction is the problem, tackle it aggressively with the help of a psychiatrist. If extra marital relations is a problem, extensive persuasion to end such relationship is required from you & from elders of the family. Consider Change of Place or city. Otherwise, end of marital relations is inevitable.",

    "Symptom": "Impotence or Erectile Dysfunction",
    "Key_Interventions": "If the man can obtain erection on his own by masturbation, but not with the wife during intercourse or cannot sustain it, then the cause is defnitely psychogenic. If Penis & testes are normally developed, primary total impotence is very rare. The Causes: Anxiety about performance - The thoughts of anticipation of impotence further increase the tension and dysfunction. Fear of rejection by wife, in case he fails to satisfy her. Feeling of guilt about sexual enjoyment - especially in orthodox families. Childhood impressions that sex is very bad, haunt the adult mind, create a guilt feeling & erection is lost. Sexual Exercise is the most important part of treatment, and demands tremendous co-operation & motivation from the couple, especially from the wife. Step 1: Non genital pleasuring. for 4 wks, the couple only limits the activity to caressing each other's bodies. Strictly, no attempt is made for intercourse. This helps to reduce the main problem of performance anxiety & fear of failure, at the same time increases affection. If one of the two, does not accept this step, then probably there is some marital problem and it is better to refer the couple to a psychiatrist for psychoanalysis. Step 2: The couple indulges in Genital pleasuring with hand or mouth, but without orgasm, and strictly no attempt at intercourse. The couple is encouraged to talk & express their pleasure to each other. If there is erection, allow it to subside, then stimulate again - to remove the fear of losing erection. Continued for at least 4 wks. Step 3: The couple is encouraged, to attain extravaginal orgasm. Gradually, penetration is permitted, but withdrawn to have ejaculation outside vagina. The husband is encouraged to practice perineal exercises mentioned below. Step 4: Finally, after several weeks, when the couple has gained confdence in itself, intravaginal ejaculation is allowed. The entire therapy is long drawn and demands tremendous co-operation from the wife. The wife must be motivated and explained her role independently, particularly stressing that if at any point, she shows negative response such as anger or frustration, the treatment will fail and problem will become even more difcult. Perineal Exercises: When there are partial erections which patient cannot maintain, ask him to practice perineal exercises. While urinating, stop the fow of urine, start again, stop & start again 4-5 times. The same act of perineal muscle contractions should be repeated several times a day.",
