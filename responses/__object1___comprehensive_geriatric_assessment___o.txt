**Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA): A Holistic Approach to Older Adult Care**

This JSON object describes the **Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)**, a cornerstone methodology in geriatric medicine and gerontology. CGA is a **multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment process** specifically designed for frail older adults, aiming to identify and manage the complex interplay of their medical, psychosocial, and functional needs.

**Key Components and Concepts:**

1.  **Object1: "Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment"**
    *   Identifies the core medical/scientific concept: a thorough, holistic evaluation of an older person.

2.  **Object2: Definition & Purpose**
    *   **Multidisciplinary:** Emphasizes the collaborative effort of various healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, therapists).
    *   **Diagnostic & Treatment:** Not just identifying problems, but also developing targeted interventions.
    *   **Frail Older Person:** Specifies the target population—individuals often with multiple comorbidities, functional decline, and vulnerability.
    *   **Holistic Assessment:** Addresses medical conditions, psychosocial well-being, and functional capabilities.
    *   **Coordinated Care Plan:** Aims to integrate findings into a cohesive, actionable strategy for ongoing care.
    *   **Improved Outcomes:** The overarching goal is to enhance the health, independence, and quality of life for older adults.

3.  **Object3: Domains of Assessment**
    *   **Physical Health:** Evaluates medical conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes), polypharmacy (multiple medications), nutritional status (malnutrition, obesity), and sensory impairments (vision, hearing), alongside common geriatric syndromes like incontinence.
    *   **Functional Status:** Assesses ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs – e.g., bathing, dressing, eating) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs – e.g., managing finances, preparing meals), which are critical indicators of independence.
    *   **Cognitive Function:** Screens for memory loss, executive dysfunction, delirium (acute confusional state), and dementia (chronic progressive cognitive decline).
    *   **Psychological Health:** Identifies mental health issues prevalent in older adults, such as depression and anxiety, which can significantly impact physical health and quality of life.
    *   **Social Support & Resources:** Assesses the availability of caregivers, social networks, and community resources crucial for maintaining independence and well-being.
    *   **Environmental Safety:** Evaluates home environment for hazards that could lead to falls or other injuries.
    *   **Spiritual Well-being:** Acknowledges the importance of existential and spiritual aspects of health for holistic care.

4.  **Object4: Proven Benefits/Outcomes**
    *   **Improved Diagnostic Accuracy:** Helps uncover treatable conditions that might be missed in routine exams due to atypical presentations in older adults.
    *   **Better Functional Outcomes:** Preserves or improves independence in ADLs/IADLs.
    *   **Reduced Mortality:** Leads to improved survival rates.
    *   **Decreased Hospitalizations & Nursing Home Admissions:** A key public health and economic benefit, reflecting better disease management and preventive care.
    *   **Improved Quality of Life:** For both the older adult and their informal caregivers.

5.  **Object5: Methodology & Implementation**
    *   **Multidisciplinary Team:** Reaffirms the necessity of collaboration among healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, social workers, physical/occupational therapists, pharmacists) to provide comprehensive expertise.
    *   **Patient, Family, Caregiver Input:** Emphasizes person-centered care, incorporating perspectives from those directly involved in the patient's daily life and decision-making.
    *   **Individualized Care Plans:** Tailors interventions to the specific needs and goals of each older adult, reflecting the heterogeneity of the aging population.
