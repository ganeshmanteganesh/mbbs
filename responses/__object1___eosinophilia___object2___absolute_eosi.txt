This JSON object describes **Eosinophilia**, a medical condition characterized by an elevated count of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Object1: Eosinophilia**
    *   **Concept:** The core medical condition. Eosinophilia refers to an increase in the absolute number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Eosinophils are granulocytes that play a role in immune responses, particularly against parasitic infections and in allergic reactions.

*   **Object2: Absolute eosinophil count >450/cu mm.**
    *   **Concept:** The diagnostic criterion for eosinophilia. An Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) measures the actual number of eosinophils per cubic millimeter of blood. A count greater than 450 cells/cu mm typically indicates eosinophilia (mild elevation; higher thresholds exist for moderate and severe forms).

*   **Object3: [Causes/Associated Conditions]**
    *   **Concept:** A comprehensive list of common medical conditions, infections, and drug reactions known to cause or be associated with eosinophilia.
        *   **Allergic/atopic conditions:** Immune hypersensitivity reactions where eosinophils are central mediators (e.g., Asthma, Urticaria/hives, Hay fever/Allergic rhinitis, Drug reactions).
        *   **Parasitic/helminthic infestations (with tissue invasion):** Infections by multicellular parasites, especially those that migrate through tissues (e.g., Roundworm, Hookworm, Filariasis). Eosinophils are a primary defense against these.
        *   **Fungal infections:** Specific systemic fungal infections (e.g., Coccidioidomycosis).
        *   **Skin diseases:** Inflammatory conditions of the skin (e.g., Dermatitis, Pemphigus, Scabies, Dermatitis herpetiformis).
        *   **Hematological diseases:** Cancers or disorders of blood cells (e.g., Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), Polycythemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, Acute myelomonocytic leukemia, Eosinophilic leukemia - a rare cancer specifically of eosinophils).
        *   **Miscellaneous:** Other syndromes and specific conditions (e.g., Tropical eosinophilia (often due to filarial infection), Pulmonary eosinophilia (eosinophils in lung tissue), LÃ¶ffler's syndrome (transient lung infiltrates with eosinophilia), Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES - persistent, unexplained eosinophilia with organ damage), Eosinophilic granuloma (a localized accumulation of eosinophils and histiocytes).
        *   **Drugs:** Specific medications known to cause eosinophilia as an adverse effect (e.g., Sulfonamide antibiotics, Aspirin, Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Allopurinol (for gout), Carbamazepine (anticonvulsant)).

*   **Object4: []**
    *   **Concept:** (Empty) Likely intended for "Symptoms" or "Clinical Presentation," which are not provided in this entry.

*   **Object5: []**
    *   **Concept:** (Empty) Likely intended for "Further Diagnostic Tests" (beyond the AEC), which are not provided.

*   **Object6: [Key Diagnostic Test]**
    *   **Concept:** The primary laboratory test used to identify and quantify eosinophilia: the "Absolute eosinophil count."

*   **Object7: [Management/Treatment]**
    *   **Concept:** The overarching treatment strategy. Eosinophilia is often a secondary manifestation of an underlying condition, so identifying and treating that primary cause is the key to management.

*   **Object8: []**
    *   **Concept:** (Empty) Likely intended for "Prognosis" or "Complications," which are not provided.
