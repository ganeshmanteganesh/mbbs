Here's a detailed explanation of the JSON object, focusing on medical/scientific concepts in a brief, informative format:

**Lichen Planus**

*   **Definition & Pathogenesis (Object2):**
    *   A chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disorder driven by autoimmune-mediated, T-cell activity targeting basal keratinocytes.
    *   Etiology largely unknown, but associated with Hepatitis C virus (especially oral forms) and drug reactions (e.g., thiazides, gold, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). Stress and dental materials are also implicated.

*   **Clinical Presentation (Object3):**
    *   Characterized by severe **pruritus** and distinctive skin lesions (the "6 P's": **P**ruritic, **P**olygonal, **P**lanar, **P**urple, **P**apules/ **P**laques).
    *   Features **Wickham's striae** (fine white reticular lines on lesion surfaces).
    *   Commonly affects flexor wrists/forearms, ankles, oral mucosa (lacy white pattern, erosions), genitals, nails (thinning, ridging, pterygium), and scalp (lichen planopilaris causing scarring alopecia).
    *   Erosive oral lesions are painful and carry an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.

*   **Diagnosis (Object4):**
    *   Primarily clinical, based on characteristic lesion morphology.
    *   Confirmed by **skin biopsy**, revealing hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, 'sawtooth' rete ridges, a lichenoid interface dermatitis with a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, and Civatte bodies (apoptotic keratinocytes).
    *   Testing for Hepatitis C (anti-HCV) is crucial due to the association.

*   **Treatment (Object5):**
    *   **First-line:** Topical corticosteroids (localized lesions), intralesional corticosteroids (hypertrophic lesions).
    *   **Systemic:** Oral corticosteroids (severe/generalized/erosive forms).
    *   **Adjunctive/Alternative:** Phototherapy (UVB, PUVA for widespread skin involvement), topical calcineurin inhibitors (oral/genital LP).
    *   **Refractory/Severe:** Systemic immunosuppressants/immunomodulators (methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, retinoids).
    *   **Symptomatic:** Antihistamines for pruritus.

*   **Complications (Object6):**
    *   Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
    *   Permanent scarring alopecia (lichen planopilaris).
    *   Increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (in chronic erosive oral/genital LP).
    *   Chronic pain (erosive oral/genital LP).
    *   Rarely, esophageal strictures (esophageal LP).
