**Tension Pneumothorax** is an acute, life-threatening medical emergency resulting from the progressive accumulation of air in the PLEURAL SPACE under positive pressure. This leads to complete COLLAPSE of the ipsilateral lung, a critical SHIFT OF THE MEDIASTINUM (heart, trachea, great vessels) to the contralateral side, and subsequent impairment of both RESPIRATION and VENOUS RETURN to the heart.

**Clinical Presentation** is characterized by ACUTE DYSPNEA, CYANOSIS, and SEVERE CHEST PAIN. Patients often exhibit MARKED TACHYCARDIA, HYPOTENSION, and signs of SHOCK. Physical examination reveals TRacheal DEVIATION away from the affected side, ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS, and HYPER-RESONANT PERCUSSION on the affected side. DISTENDED NECK VEINS and PULSUS PARADOXUS (an abnormally large decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse wave amplitude during inspiration) may also be present due to compromised cardiovascular function.

**Diagnosis** is primarily CLINICAL, and IMMEDIATE TREATMENT should NOT BE DELAYED for imaging. If the patient's condition allows, a CHEST X-RAY would confirm a collapsed lung, MEDIASTINAL SHIFT, and absence of lung markings on the affected side. ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES (ABG) typically show HYPOXIA and HYPERCAPNIA.

**Management** requires immediate, life-saving intervention. The definitive initial step is EMERGENCY NEEDLE DECOMPRESSION, where a large-bore needle (e.g., 14-gauge) is inserted into the 2ND INTERCOSTAL SPACE at the MIDCLAVICULAR LINE on the affected side to release the trapped air. This procedure converts the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax and is immediately FOLLOWED BY CHEST TUBE INSERTION with UNDERWATER SEAL DRAINAGE to ensure continuous air evacuation and lung re-expansion. Supplemental OXYGEN ADMINISTRATION and supportive care for SHOCK (e.g., INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS) are also crucial.

**Complications** are severe and include CARDIOVASCULAR COLLAPSE, CARDIAC ARREST, RESPIRATORY FAILURE, and DEATH if not promptly recognized and treated.
