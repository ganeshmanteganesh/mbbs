**Kikuchi's Disease (Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis)**

*   **Definition:** A rare, benign, self-limiting lymphadenitis characterized by histiocytic necrosis within affected lymph nodes.
*   **Etiology:** The precise cause is **unknown (idiopathic)**. No specific infectious agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria) or definitive genetic factors have been consistently identified.
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   Most commonly presents as **painless cervical lymphadenopathy** (enlarged lymph nodes in the neck).
    *   Often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as **fever, flu-like symptoms (malaise, fatigue), and skin rashes**.
*   **Key Diagnostic Findings:**
    *   Clinically, the hallmark is **painless cervical lymphadenopathy**.
    *   **Definitive diagnosis requires lymph node biopsy**, which reveals characteristic histological features: **foci of necrotic histiocytes** (macrophage-like cells) and lymphocytes, often without significant granulocytic infiltration.
*   **Diagnostic Procedures:** Primarily **lymph node biopsy** for histopathological examination.
*   **Treatment & Prognosis:**
    *   **Symptomatic treatment** (e.g., NSAIDs for fever/pain) is the standard approach.
    *   The disease is typically **self-limiting**, with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within weeks to months.
*   **Associations:** Occasionally reported in association with systemic autoimmune diseases, most notably **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**, suggesting a potential autoimmune component in some cases.
