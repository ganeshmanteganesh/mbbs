### Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)

**1. Disease Identity:**
*   **Object1:** Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) – A clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm originating from a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell.

**2. Disease Phases:**
*   **Object2:** CML progresses through distinct clinical stages:
    *   **Chronic stable phase:** Initial, usually prolonged phase, often asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.
    *   **Accelerated phase:** Transitional phase with increasing disease aggressiveness, characterized by worsening cytopenias/cytoses and evolving blast counts.
    *   **Blast crisis phase:** Terminal phase resembling acute leukemia, highly aggressive, and often refractory to treatment.

**3. Pathophysiology:**
*   **Object3:** The core mechanisms of CML involve:
    *   **Stem Cell Origin:** Acquired defect in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, leading to dysregulated production of myeloid cell lines.
    *   **Panmyelosis:** Overproduction of granulocytes, erythroid precursors, and megakaryocytes, resulting in increased cellularity in blood and bone marrow.
    *   **Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph):** The defining genetic hallmark, a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, written as t(9;22).
    *   **BCR-ABL1 Fusion Gene:** This chromosomal translocation creates a hybrid oncogene on the der(22) chromosome. This gene produces an oncoprotein with constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity, leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis).

**4. Clinical Manifestations (Symptoms):**
*   **Object4:**
    *   **Chronic stable phase:** Early often asymptomatic. Later, non-specific symptoms (fatigue, weakness, weight loss, anorexia) due to hypermetabolic state; massive splenomegaly (abdominal fullness, early satiety, pain, dyspnea); fever, sweating; priapism (due to leukostasis); bleeding tendencies (late).
    *   **Accelerated phase:** Increasing anemia, rising white blood cell count (WBC), circulating immature cells, increasing splenomegaly, basophilia (>20%), persistent thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis.
    *   **Blast crisis phase:** Often treatment refractory. Abrupt increase in spleen size, bone pain, sternal tenderness, worsening anemia, bleeding, generalized lymphadenopathy.

**5. Physical Examination & Cytology (Morphology):**
*   **Object5:**
    *   **Chronic stable phase:** Pallor, moderate to massive splenomegaly (non-tender), mild hepatomegaly, sternal tenderness/bone pain. Peripheral smear shows moderate normocytic normochromic anemia, granulocytic "left shift" (granulocytes at all maturation stages, neutrophils and myelocytes predominant), blasts <10%, increased basophils (<20%) and eosinophils; variable platelet count.
    *   **Accelerated phase:** Blasts 10-19% in blood or bone marrow, worsening anemia, rising WBC, increasing splenomegaly, increased basophils.
    *   **Blast crisis phase:** Blasts ≥20% (myeloid or lymphoid phenotype) in blood or bone marrow, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, generalized lymphadenopathy.

**6. Diagnostic & Monitoring Investigations:**
*   **Object6:**
    *   **Hematology:** Hemoglobin <11 g/dL. Markedly elevated Total Leukocyte Count (TLC >20,000/µL, often >100,000/µL). Variable platelet count.
    *   **Peripheral Smear:** Confirms normocytic normochromic anemia, granulocytic left shift, increased basophils/eosinophils, blasts <10% (chronic phase).
    *   **Bone Marrow Study:** Markedly hypercellular with granulocytic hyperplasia; fibrosis can occur in later chronic phase (20-30%).
    *   **Cytogenetics/Molecular Genetics (CRUCIAL):**
        *   **Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph):** Detected in >95% via conventional cytogenetics. If Ph-negative by cytogenetics, FISH or RT-PCR are used to detect the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene.
        *   **BCR-ABL1 Fusion Gene:** Demonstrated in peripheral blood or bone marrow, confirming the molecular diagnosis.
    *   **NAP/LAP Score:** Decreased (<20), helping differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction (which has a high score).
    *   **Biochemical:** Increased serum LDH, uric acid (due to high cell turnover), serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum vitamin B12. False decrease in blood glucose due to leukocyte metabolism in vitro.
    *   **Monitoring (post-treatment):** Bone marrow biopsy for cytogenetic response; quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) for molecular response (BCR-ABL1 transcript levels).

**7. Treatment Strategies:**
*   **Object7:**
    *   **Goal:** Achieve complete molecular remission (eradication of BCR-ABL1 transcript).
    *   **First-line (Chronic phase):** Imatinib mesylate (a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, TKI) – targets the BCR-ABL1 kinase, achieving high rates of hematological and cytogenetic response. Continued indefinitely. (Side effects: nausea, fluid retention, myelosuppression).
    *   **Second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib):** Used for imatinib failure, resistance, or progression.
    *   **Other Chemotherapy:** Recombinant interferon-α (rINF-α, for imatinib failure, reduces cellularity), hydroxycarbamide (cytoreduction), melphalan, busulphan, Omacetaxine (for TKI resistance).
    *   **Splenectomy:** For symptomatic massive splenomegaly or recurrent splenic infarctions.
    *   **Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT):** Potentially curative, especially for younger patients with suitable donors in early chronic phase (~70% cure rate); also an option for TKI non-responders, accelerated phase, or blast crisis.
    *   **Phase-specific treatment:** Hydroxyurea for accelerated phase; treatment protocols similar to acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia for blast crisis.

**8. Complications:**
*   **Object8:**
    *   **Vascular:** Thrombotic episodes (DVT, MI, Budd-Chiari syndrome) or bleeding manifestations (due to platelet dysfunction/count abnormalities).
    *   **Gastrointestinal:** Peptic ulcer, hyperuricemia (leading to gout, uric acid stones, nephropathy).
    *   **Organ-specific:** Priapism, splenic infarction (due to leukostasis/hyperviscosity).
    *   **Disease Progression:** Transformation into more aggressive phases (accelerated phase, blast crisis) or other acute leukemias (acute myelogenous/nonlymphocytic leukemia) or myelofibrosis.
    *   **Treatment-related:** Myelosuppression, fluid retention, hepatotoxicity, flu-like syndrome (IFN-α), Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) post-SCT.
